    <h1>PROJECT 1 REPORT BY CHASE BRILES</h1>
  <p>1. The site was created for the Mens Club lacrosse team members and thier parents to get information
      like practice schedule and up comming games.
  </p>    
  <p>2. The content was competely original and through my creation, the animation was made by the help of a 
      W3 Schools tutorial and the images came from the mens club lacrosse team instagram as well as the teams
      media director Matt Neff or Neff Media.
  </p>
  <p>3. The site contains five separate pages, it has the home page where serves as an intro to the team
      and the overall site, the schedule page that has the up comming game schedule as well as links to the game
      locations through google maps.
  </p>
  <p>4.The site holds the James Madison Men's Club Lacrosse header along with pictures of the duke dog on each side
      this header is through out the website.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.The site has navigation links under the header that are each tied to one of the five webpages that were required.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. The site resizes pictures and takes away pictures on a mobile resize, the title also shrinks to fit the smaller screen
    as well as the meet the team page turns into one column for each player card.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. All repeated style rules are in the sitestyle.css file, other css files tweak the over all main when needed
    to help with row or column layout for the best results on the page.
  </p>
  <p>8. All the pictures have alt attributes that describe the image for screen readers with short descripions.
  </p>
  <p>
      9.Each page declares the JMU club lacrosse logo that is displayed on the instagram.
  </p>
  <p>
      10.Each non html resource has been placed into its appropriate folder.
  </p>
  <p>
      11. I did not use any bootstrap or any other frame works for this project. It is all HTML and CSS.
  </p>
  <p> 12. Each page has been tested with Nu Validator and every one came up with no errors or warnings</p>
  <p> 13. Content is aligned with what I felt best for the overall layout of each page, game schedule is set up as a grid, while the contact form is centered
      for ease of use and simplicity.
  </p>
  <p>14. All the text has at least some margin to it to make sure that here is no over lap aswell as most pictures.</p>
  <p>15. The site uses multiple different fonts at the normal paragraph level, header markers in schedule pages and contact page, as well as in the nav links</p>
  <p>16. The site has one from on the contacts page that holds a check box for a mailing list sign up, text fields for email and full name, and a message box for the
      user to place and send thier message.
  </p>
  <p>17. The site has links to the teams social media pages at the bottom footer, it also has google map links to game locations on the schedule page.</p>
  <p>18. Kebabe case has been favored for ids and classes through out the site and style files.</p>
  <p>19.The sites animation is a type writer animation on the home page that prints out "GO DUKES!" with a yellow flashing cursor, it runs once to keep it from being
      distracting on the page.
  </p>
  <p>20. The sites repository has been shared to hcientist on Git hub.</p>
  <p>21. All files are lower case.</p>
  <p>22 & 23. All pages on the site are redirected to HTTPS encryption, any one through port 80 is redirected through port 443</p>
